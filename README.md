# Computer Graphics Project - Terrain Generation and 3D Environment

This repository contains the implementation of a detailed 3D terrain generation and rendering system using JavaScript and three.js. The project includes modules for terrain generation, rendering, sky simulation, and user interaction through a graphical interface.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a three-dimensional representation of terrain, simulate a day/night cycle, and provide user controls for interaction. The project is divided into several modules, each with specific functionalities.

## Modules

### terrainGeneration.mjs
This module creates a three-dimensional representation of detailed terrain using plane geometry.

#### Functions:
- **randomizeTerrain(noise, pGeom):** Randomizes the terrain by defining the heights of the vertices using noise generated by the Noise.js library. It calculates the heights using different scales and amplitudes to create varied terrain.
- **updateHeightmap(noise, pGeom, value):** Updates the terrain height map with a provided value. Heights are calculated similarly to the previous function but are multiplied by the provided value to adjust the elevation of the land.

### rendering.mjs
This module uses the three.js library to create a 3D environment, including terrain and camera controls. It also incorporates a day/night cycle simulation.

#### Features:
- Creates a three-dimensional scene, camera, and renderer to display elements on the screen.
- Initializes terrain and applies noise for realistic details.
- Sets up camera controls to allow user exploration of the 3D environment.
- Enables pausing by pressing the 'S' key.
- Manages keyboard events for camera movement.
- Continuously renders the scene with a day/night cycle by adjusting the position of the sun and moon.
- Exports important variables like the scene and camera for use in other modules.

### skysphere.mjs
This module creates celestial elements such as the sun and moon using three.js.

#### Functions:
- **addSkyObjects(scene):** Adds the sun and moon to the scene with their light, shadow, color, and position properties. The sun is represented by a yellow light and sphere, while the moon is represented by a white light and sphere. Controls the apparent movement of the sun and moon to simulate the day/night cycle.

### uicontrols.mjs
This module develops a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the rendered scene.

#### Features:
- Provides options to adjust terrain color, sun intensity, control rain, and modify wind intensity.
- GUI created with the Dat.GUI library for easy control configuration and usage.

### addons.mjs
This module adds rainfall to the three.js scene and allows for its removal.

#### Features:
- Represents rain as falling points that move randomly in the presence of wind.
- Controls the intensity of rain and wind through a graphical interface.

### main.js
This module performs essential actions such as setting the initial terrain surface, adding event listeners, and starting the rendering process.

#### Features:
- Calls the **updateHeightmap** function to set the initial terrain surface.
- Adds event listeners for redefining or generating a new random map.
- Calls **initializeRendering()** and **render()** to start the scene presentation.

## Extras
Due to code incompatibilities, some extras are distributed among the uicontrols, skysphere, and rendering modules. These include:
- Sun intensity control
- Wind control and its effect on rain direction
- Camera movement within the map using keyboard arrows

## Usage Instructions
1. Ensure you have an HTTP server running to serve the files.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to start the application.
3. Use the GUI to adjust terrain and environmental parameters.
4. Interact with the 3D scene using mouse and keyboard controls.
